Installing KBMOD
----------------

To build KBMOD you will require:
* GPU and drivers
* Cuda Toolkit >= 8.0
* CMake >= 3.12

Ensure your NVIDIA drivers are correctly installed and that the graphics cards are visible and working normally. The easiest way to achieve this would be to run

.. code-block:: bash
		
    nvidia-smi


Ensure that the NVIDIA's ``nvcc`` compiler is available on your system and is visible by running

.. code-block:: bash
		
    nvcc --version


It is possible that the compiler is installed but not discoverable. In that case add its location to the system environment ``PATH`` variable by, if using ``bash`` for example, setting

.. code-block:: bash
		
   export PATH=/path/to/cuda:$PATH


If CUDA Toolkit is not availible on your system follow their `offical installation instructions <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_. Optionally, if you use Anaconda virtual environments, the CUDA Toolkit is also availible as ``conda install cudatoolkit-dev``. Depending on the version of drivers on your GPU, you might need to use an older cudatoolkit-dev version.

Running KBMOD
-------------
   
To run a search, KBMOD must be provided with

* appropriately pre-processed input data (see :ref:`Input Files`)
* appropriate search and filter parameters (see :ref:`Masking`)

The search is initiated via the :py:class:`~~kbmod.run_search.run_search` class and consists of several phases:

* Data is loaded from the input files as specified above (see :ref:`Input Files` for more details).
* Masks are applied to the images to remove invalid pixels (see :ref:`Masking` for more details).
* The shift and stack approach is used to search for potential trajectories originating from each pixel in the first image.
* The list of potential trajectories is filtered using various metrics.
* Remaining trajectories are clustered to remove duplicates. Only one trajectory per cluster is kept.
* The found trajectories are compared against known objects and matches are indicated.
* The found trajectories are output to result files for later analysis.

  
Data Model
----------

KBMOD uses an hierarchy of three nested data structures to store the image data over which it searches.

ImageStack
__________

The :py:class:`~kbmod.search.ImageStack` holds all of the image data for every time step. The main information stored is the images array, which holds one :py:class:`~kbmod.search.LayeredImage` structure for each time step. The ImageStack also stores information that applies for all images such as a ``globalMask`` and an ``avgTemplate``.


LayeredImage
____________

Each layered image holds the data from a single exposure, which consists of multiple layers including: a science image (the flux values), the variance image (representing the noise at each pixel), and MaskImage (representing per-pixel errors). In addition the :py:class:`~kbmod.search.LayeredImage` tracks per-exposure information such as the PSF for the image and the time at which the image was taken.


RawImages
_________

A :py:class:`~kbmod.search.RawImage` is the lowest level of data storage and effectively consists of a two-dimensional array of floating point values. These values can take on a variety of meanings depending on the use, including flux values, variance values, mask indicators, psi values, and phi values.
