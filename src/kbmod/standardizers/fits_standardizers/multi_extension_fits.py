    """Suppports processing of a single, multi-extension FITS file.

    Extensions for which it's possible to extract WCS, bounding boxes and masks
    are required to be places in the ``exts`` attribute. For single extension
    FITS files this is the primary header, as it contains the image data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    location : `str`
        Location of the FITS file, can be an URI or local filesystem path.
    set_exts : `bool`
        When `True`, finds all HDUs that are image-like and sets them as
        elements of `exts` list. Note that using the default `_isImageLike`
        implementation is rather costly as it loads the whole data into memory.

    Attributes
    ----------
    hdulist : `~astropy.io.fits.HDUList`
        All HDUs found in the FITS file
    primary : `~astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`
        The primary HDU.
    exts : `list`
        All HDUs from `hdulist` marked as "image-like" for further processing
        with KBMOD. Does not include the  primary HDU, when it doesn't contain
        any image data. Contains at least 1 entry.
    wcs : `list`
        WCSs associated with the processable image data. Will contain at least
        1 WCS.
    bbox : `list`
        Bounding boxes associated with each WCS.

        HDU is determined to be an image if it's one of the primary, image or
        compressed image types in Astropy and its ``.data`` attribute is not
        empty, but a 2D array with dimensions less than 6000 rows and columns.

        This is a generic best-guess implementation and there are no guarantees
        that the retrieved extensions are science images, i.e. images
        containing the actual sky, and not a small table-like HDU, guider or
        focus chip images.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hdu : `astropy.fits.HDU`
            Header unit to inspect.
