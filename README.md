An image processing library for moving object detection implemented with GPUs.  
Based on a Maximum Likelihood detection algorithm for moving astronomical objects.

KBMOD is a set of Python tools to search astronomical images for moving
objects based upon method of maximum likelihood detection.

## Updates and Changes

For a list of major changes, including breaking changes to the code, please see the [Major-Changes](https://github.com/dirac-institute/kbmod/wiki/Major-Changes) wiki page.

## Setup

**Requirements**

The packages required to build the code are:

* python3 development headers
* Scipy (Numpy, Matplotlib)
* Astropy and astroquery
* Scikit-learn
* Cuda 8.0
* CMake 3

**To install:**  
Open search/pybinds/CmakeLists.txt and verify in the "include_directories" section that the paths to the python headers and to the cuda installation are correct.  You might also need to add a line
such as ```$ENV{HOME}/.conda/envs/CONDA_ENV_NAME/lib``` to ```link_directories``` where ```CONDA_ENV_NAME``` is the name of the conda environment you are using.

Then run 
```source install.bash```
This will build the python library and run the tests.

If you log out, next time run
```source setup.bash```
to reappend the library to the python path

If the code appears to compile correctly, but `import kbmod` fails, try creating an anaconda environment with a python version that matches system python and recompiling.

Some cuda versions no longer include `helper_cuda.h` and `helper_string.h`. These can be added to the `src/` directory with
```
cd search/src
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/master/Common/helper_cuda.h
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/master/Common/helper_string.h
```

## Usage

A short example injecting a simulated object into a stack of images, and then recovering it.

```python

from kbmodpy import kbmod as kb
import numpy as np

# Create a point spread function
psf = kb.psf(1.5)

# load images from list of file paths
imgs =  [ kb.layered_image(file, psf) for file in example_files ]

# Specify an artificial object
flux = 175.0
position = (100.7, 150.3)
velocity = (50, 35)

# Inject object into images
for im in imgs:
    im.add_object(position[0]+im.get_time()*velocity[0], 
                  position[1]+im.get_time()*velocity[1], 
                  flux)

# Recover the object by searching a wide region
velocity_guess = (40, 40)
radius = 20
min_lh = 9.0
min_obs = 10
stack = kb.image_stack(imgs)
search = kb.stack_search(stack)
results = search.region_search(*velocity_guess, radius, min_lh, min_obs)

```
