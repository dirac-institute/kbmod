An image processing library for moving object detection implemented with GPUs.  
Based on a Maximum Likelihood detection algorithm for moving astronomical objects.

KBMOD is a set of Python tools to search astronomical images for moving
objects based upon method of maximum likelihood detection. For more information on the KBMOD algorithm see the following papers:
* [Fast Algorithms for Slow Moving Asteroids: Constraints on the Distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..119W/abstract) by Whidden et. al. (2019)
* [Sifting Through the Static: Moving Object Detection in Difference Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03296) by Smotherman et. al. (2021)

## Requirements

To build `kbmod` The packages required to build the code are:
* Cuda Toolkit >= 8.0
* CMake >= 3.12

Ensure that the NVIDIA's `nvcc` compiler is available on your system, for example:
```
nvcc --version
```
It is possible that the compiler is installed but not discoverable. In that case add its location to `PATH`. For example, if using `bash`  do `export PATH=/path/to/cuda:$PATH`. The default location for CUDA Toolkit installation is usually `/usr/local/cuda-XY.Z**` where `XY.Z` represent the CUDA Toolkit version that was installed.    
If using `bash` add the appropriate command to `~/.bashrc` in order to avoid having to set it repeatedly.

If CUDA Toolkit is not availible on your system follow their [offical installation instructions](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Optionally, if you use Anaconda virtual environments, the CUDA Toolkit is also availible as `conda install cudatoolkit-dev`. Depending on the version of drivers on your GPU, you might need to use an older cudatoolkit-dev version.

## Installation

Clone this repository, including all of its submodules:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dirac-institute/kbmod.git
```

Build
```
cd kbmod
pip install .
```

This builds the package and all the dependencies required to test, run KBMOD on images and read the results. To use the additional analysis tools available in the `analysis` module it is necessary to install additional dependencies:
```
pip install .[analysis]
```
Note, however, that some of the dependencies in the `analysis` module require packages and supplementary data that are not installed nor provided by KBMoD. 

To verify that the installation was successful run the tests:
```
cd tests/
python -m unittest
```

### For Developers

If you want to contribute to the development of KBMOD, it is recommended that you install it in editable mode:
```
pip install -e .
```
Changes you make to the Python source files will then take immediate effect. To recompile the C++ code it's easiest to re-install the package in editable mode again. 

It is possible to build only the C++ code via `cmake`. 
```
cmake -B src/kbmod -S .
cmake --build src/kbmod --clean-first
```
To rebuild, it is sufficient to just re-run the `cmake --build` command. Optionally, invoke the cmake generated `Makefile` as `make clean && make` from the `src/kbmod` directory.

If you want to buid the documentation you must have pandoc which seems not installable by pip.
See [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), or if you are using conda:
```
conda install pandoc
```
Building the documentation in docs/build/html using sphinx:
```
pip install .[docs]
sphinx-build -t html docs/source docs/build
```
Or you can use the make to call sphinx:
```
cd docs
make clean html
```
## Usage

A short example injecting a simulated object into a stack of images, and then recovering it. This example is also included in `tests/test_readme_example.py`.

```python

import kbmod.search as kb
import numpy as np

# Create a point spread function
psf = kb.psf(1.5)

# Create fake data with ten 512x512 pixel images.
from kbmod.fake_data_creator import *
ds = FakeDataSet(512, 512, 10)
imgs = ds.stack.get_images()

# Get the timestamp of the first image.
t0 = imgs[0].get_time()
print(f"Image times start at {t0}.")

# Specify an artificial object
flux = 275.0
position = (10.7, 15.3)
velocity = (2, 0)

# Inject object into images
for im in imgs:
    dt = im.get_time() - t0
    im.add_object(position[0] + dt * velocity[0], 
                  position[1] + dt * velocity[1], 
                  flux)

# Create a new image stack with the inserted object.
stack = kb.image_stack(imgs)

# Recover the object by searching a set of trajectories.
search = kb.stack_search(stack)
search.search(
    5,  # Number of search angles to try (-0.1, -0.05, 0.0, 0.05, 0.1)
    5,  # Number of search velocities to try (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    -0.1,  # The minimum search angle to test
    0.1,  # The maximum search angle to test
    0,  # The minimum search velocity to test
    4,  # The maximum search velocity to test
    7,  # The minimum number of observations
)

# Get the top 10 results.
results = search.get_results(0, 10)
print(results)
```
